## Why did I sign up for Introduction to Web Accessibility?

I enrolled into this course because I wanted to know more about how other people interact with web.

## How did it go?

### Week one 
This module introduces different accessibility tools for web, who uses them and how are they used. What like about this course is that it goes a bit below the surface i.e.: I knew what is screen reader before enrolling into this MOOC, but i have never really seen anyone using it, or the fact that even within people with similar disability the use of accessibility tools can vary. 

#### So what is Web Accessibility?
So far I have learned that from design perspective disability can be seen as mismatch between service and user. Web Accessibility means actively avoiding this mismatch.
